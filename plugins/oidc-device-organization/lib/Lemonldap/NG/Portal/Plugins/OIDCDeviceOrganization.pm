# Organizational Device Authorization - Extension to RFC 8628
#
# When a RP is configured with oidcRPMetaDataOptionsDeviceOwnership='organization',
# the tokens issued via Device Authorization Grant identify the *client application*
# (the enrolled device) rather than the *admin who approved* the enrollment.
#
# This is useful for enrolling servers, kiosks, smart TVs, etc. that belong to
# the organization. The admin approves the enrollment but the resulting token
# survives the admin leaving the organization.
#
# Implementation: hooks into oidcDeviceCodeGrant (provided by OIDCDeviceAuthorization
# plugin) and replaces the user session data with a synthetic session whose identity
# is the client_id.

    # gets a long-lived *offline* refresh token (the durable machine identity,
    # decoupled from the admin's SSO session — RFC 8628 / OIDC offline_access).
    #
    # The classic objection — "offline refresh re-resolves the user in the
    # UserDB and fails for the synthetic client_id" — does not apply here:
    # Open Bastion never uses the core /oauth2/token refresh grant for these
    # tokens. The PamAccess /pam/heartbeat endpoint mints fresh access tokens
    # directly from the refresh token's stored (synthetic) session data, so
    # the UserDB is never queried at refresh time. The synthetic attributes
    # are copied into the refresh token via %$session_data below.

    # Replace session_data so tokens carry synthetic attributes
    %$session_data = %{ $session->data };

    # Stable, unique per-device identifier carried into every token derived from
    # this enrollment (access + refresh), so downstream consumers (PamAccess
    # bastion vouching) can identify the individual device — not just its shared,
    # project-wide client_id. We derive it as a SHA-256 digest of the synthetic
    # session id rather than exposing the id itself: the value is surfaced in
    # tokens and API responses (e.g. the /pam/bastion-token probe), and the raw
    # session id is a live credential — anyone who learned it could replay it as
    # a `lemonldap` cookie and impersonate the synthetic session. The digest is
    # deterministic (stable across refreshes), unique per device, and one-way.
    #
    # The fixed prefix is domain separation: with hashedSessionStore enabled the
    # backend storage key is itself sha256_hex(session id), so a bare
    # sha256_hex(session id) here would equal that internal key. Prefixing
    # guarantees the exposed device-id can never coincide with a LLNG storage
    # key, in either storage mode.
