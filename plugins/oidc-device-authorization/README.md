# OIDC Device Authorization - RFC 8628

This plugin implements [RFC 8628 - OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8628)
for LemonLDAP::NG.

## Features

- **Device code endpoint** (`/oauth2/device`): issues device and user codes
- **User verification page** (`/device`): portal page for users to enter the
  device code and approve/deny
- **Device code grant type** on the token endpoint
  (`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`)
- **PKCE support** for additional security
- **Configurable** expiration, polling interval, user code length and
  invalid-code lockout

## Requirements

- LemonLDAP::NG >= 2.23.2
- OIDC issuer must be enabled

## Installation

With `lemonldap-ng-store` _(LLNG >= 2.24.0)_ or [linagora-lemonldap-ng-store](../../README.md#installation-with-debian-packages):

```bash
sudo lemonldap-ng-store install oidc-device-authorization
```

Manually: copy `lib/` and `portal-templates/` into the appropriate directories,
copy `manager-overrides/` into `/etc/lemonldap-ng/manager-overrides.d/`,
add `::Plugins::OIDCDeviceAuthorization` to `customPlugins`, and run
`llng-build-manager-files`.

## Configuration

### OIDC Service Settings

In the Manager under **OpenID Connect Service** > **Device Authorization**:

| Parameter                                       | Default | Range   | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `oidcServiceDeviceAuthorizationExpiration`      | `600`   | 60-3600 | Device code TTL (seconds)                                        |
| `oidcServiceDeviceAuthorizationPollingInterval` | `5`     | 1-60    | Min polling interval (seconds)                                   |
| `oidcServiceDeviceAuthorizationUserCodeLength`  | `8`     | 8-20    | User code length                                                 |
| `oidcServiceDeviceAuthorizationMaxFailures`     | `5`     | 0-100   | Invalid codes a session may submit before lockout (0 = disabled) |
| `oidcServiceDeviceAuthorizationLockoutDelay`    | `300`   | 30-3600 | How long that lockout lasts (seconds)                            |

The user code length has a floor of 8 for a reason: over the 20-character
alphabet of RFC 8628 section 6.1 that is ~34 bits of entropy, above the 20 bits
the RFC asks for. A code of 5 characters would leave 3.2 M candidates,
brute-forceable inside the code TTL.

The lockout is per SSO session and independent of CrowdSec: after
`MaxFailures` invalid codes, that session cannot submit any code — valid ones
included — for `LockoutDelay` seconds. A valid submission clears the counter.
CrowdSec, when configured, still gets an alert per invalid code
(`llng/device-auth-bruteforce` scenario) and adds IP-level protection.

### Per-RP Settings

| Parameter                                       | Default | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `oidcRPMetaDataOptionsAllowDeviceAuthorization` | `0`     | Enable Device Authorization Grant for this RP |

## Who may approve an enrollment

`oidcRPMetaDataOptionsAllowDeviceAuthorization` is a **boolOrExpr**, not a
plain flag, and the difference matters:

- `0` — the RP cannot use the device grant at all.
- `1` — the grant is enabled **and any authenticated user may approve (or deny)
  an enrollment for this RP**. There is no further check: whoever holds an SSO
  session and a pending user code becomes the identity behind the enrolled
  device.
- _an expression_ — the grant is enabled and the expression is evaluated,
  against the approving user's session, on every approve and deny.

**Enrolling a device is granting it an identity, so the expression form is the
recommended configuration.** For example, restricting approval to a group:

```
oidcRPMetaDataOptionsAllowDeviceAuthorization = $groups =~ /\bdeviceadmins\b/
```

### Restricting the verification page itself

The expression above governs the decision. You can also keep unauthorized
users away from the `/device` page entirely, with a `locationRules` entry on
the **portal's own virtual host** — the portal runs itself through the handler,
so its vhost rules apply to portal paths:

```
Virtual Hosts > auth.example.com > Access rules
    ^/device   ->   $groups =~ /\bdeviceadmins\b/
    default    ->   accept
```

> **The rule must not be anchored at the end.** Access rules are matched
> against `REQUEST_URI`, **query string included**, so `^/device$` would not
> match `/device?user_code=ABCD-EFGH` — the very URL RFC 8628's
> `verification_uri_complete` sends users to. Write `^/device`.

A `locationRules` entry alone is a coarse gate (it hides the page); the
per-RP expression is the one evaluated at decision time, for every RP. Use
both.

## Logging and audit

The plugin never logs a user code in cleartext, and never stores one: the
lookup record is keyed on `sha256_hex(user_code)`, and the debug/info lines
carry that digest. The audit log (`ISSUER_OIDC_DEVICE_AUTH_*`) does record the
submitted code on approve/deny, which is what ties an enrollment to the admin
who authorized it; `ISSUER_OIDC_DEVICE_AUTH_TOKEN_GRANTED`, emitted where only
the device code is known, carries `user_code_hash` instead.
