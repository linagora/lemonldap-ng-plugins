# ============================================================================
# Regression: pamAccessServerGroups resolution must use the OIDC client_id,
# NOT the per-device `_deviceId`.
#
# pamAccessServerGroups is keyed by client_id (one OIDC client per project,
# the group shared by every bastion of that project). When the
# oidc-device-organization plugin is enabled, the device-grant tokens also
# carry a per-device `_deviceId` (a SHA-256 digest) which PamAccess uses as the
# audit / voucher-binding bastion identity.
#
# A previous version passed that `_deviceId` to _resolveServerGroup. Since the
# digest is never a key of pamAccessServerGroups, EVERY enrollment carrying a
# `_deviceId` was rejected with "Unknown enrolled server" at /pam/authorize --
# even though its client_id was correctly mapped.
#
# This test exercises exactly that combination (device-organization stamping a
# `_deviceId` + pamAccessServerGroups configured) and asserts the endpoint
# resolves the group by client_id and accepts the caller, while still rejecting
# a caller-forged group that contradicts the mapping.
